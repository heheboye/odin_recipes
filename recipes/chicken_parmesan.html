    <h2>How to Make Chicken Parmesan</h2>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
    <p>In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pound chicken to an even thickness</li>
        <p>Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</p>
        <li>Don't skimp on seasoning</li>
        <p>Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</p>
        <li>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs</li>
        <p>Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</p>
        <li>Rest before cooking</li>
        <p>Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.</p>
        <li>Go easy on the sauce</li>
        <p>THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?</p>
        <li>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot</li>
        <p>Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.</p>
